The part2a.png shows the infomation of circuit.
1.
(1) aig v.s. strash
a. aig : By command aig, the circuit will remain be stored in "logic" type and only convert the node of logic network into aig representation.
b. strash : It will convert the whole circuit into "aig" type.
(2) bdd v.s. collapse
a. bdd : By command bdd, the circuit will remain be stored in "logic" type and only convert the node of logic network into bdd representation.
b. collapse : It will convert the whole circuit into "bdd" type.
2. use command "logic"
