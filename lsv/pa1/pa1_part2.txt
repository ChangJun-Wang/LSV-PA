(a)
  1.  
    The command "aig" simply transforms the logic network into an AIG. 
    On the other hand, the command "strash" transforms the logic network into an AIG by one-level structural hashing to ensure that no two AND gates have identical pairs of incoming edges.
  2.
    The command "bdd" simply transforms the logic network into a BDD
    On the orther hand, the command "collapse" transforms the network by recursively composing the fanin nodes into the fanout nodes. Thus, it has the relatively smaller curcuit.

(b)
  use command "logic"
