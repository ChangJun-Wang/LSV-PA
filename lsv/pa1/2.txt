1.
aig:retain the logic network and convertlocal logic function into aig
strash: transforms combinational logic into an AIG including whole graph 

2.
bdd:retain the logic network and convertlocal logic function into bdd 
when show_bdd it only shows the nodes of top level to express the function

collapse: transforms combinational logic into bdd including whole graph  
when show_bdd it expands all nodes until touch the primary input
