================================================================
(a)
1. 
In the logic network in AIG(by command aig) it transform the node 
functions to AIG(which is the local function) but it global is a 
logic network
In the structrually hashed AIG(by command strash) it transforms the
combinational logic (the whole graph) into an AIG
2. 
In the the logic network in BDD(by command bdd) it do not expand all
the nodes of the BDD network, but retain the logic network as the form
of BDD.
In the collapsed BDD(by command collapse) it expand all the nodes of
the BDD network, until the primary input

(b)
logic
